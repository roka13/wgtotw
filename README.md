=========
A Web-site build on a clone from  Anax-base. This is the final project in PHPMVC on BTH 
This clone is completed with Dbtables and new tests for Dbtables  

##Setup  

Download or clone this content to your own server.
Control that you have full access to the data-folder.
This clone has two users from the beginning. They are setup in app/src/Dbtables/DBrestore.php    
 To login use the email account and password of admin.   To alter this you have to edit the function PopulateUsers().
Do not change the nickname RGK. It is used in many files to check if admin is logged in.
In the database-menue you can reset all tables and also view their contents.
